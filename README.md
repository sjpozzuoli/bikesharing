# Bike Sharing

### The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. With the raw data from Citibike, multiple visuals were created to show the full picture and make this an attractive investment opportunity. 

## Results

#### After examining the raw data and using Tableau to create dashboards, I was able to uncover some very interesting information that would be useful in an investor pitch.

#### Here we can see the most poopular times of the day for bike rides during the month of August. This is a useful chart because it can help us to determine the best times of the day to perform bike repairs (if necessary), and when to have employees out delivering bikes to the pickup stations to replenish empty stations. The most popular times of the day are around morning and evening rush hours, showing that many people utilize the service to get to and from work.

#### These two charts are the same except the second one is broken down by gender. The first one shows that trips, on average, last about 10 minutes. The most popular ride times range between 0 and 25 minutes, with sharp declines after that. Secondly, the longer trips seem to be taken by males based on the slightly more gradual decrease in the second line chart.
