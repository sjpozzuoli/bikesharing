# Bike Sharing

### The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. With the raw data from Citibike, multiple visuals were created to show the full picture and make this an attractive investment opportunity. 

## Results

#### After examining the raw data and using Tableau to create dashboards, I was able to uncover some very interesting information that would be useful in an investor pitch.

#### The above shows the breakdown by gender of riders. It shows that there are about three times more male riders than female riders.

#### Here we can see the most poopular times of the day for bike rides during the month of August. This is a useful chart because it can help us to determine the best times of the day to perform bike repairs (if necessary), and when to have employees out delivering bikes to the pickup stations to replenish empty stations. The most popular times of the day are around morning and evening rush hours, showing that many people utilize the service to get to and from work.

#### These two charts are the same except the second one is broken down by gender. The first one shows that trips, on average, last about 10 minutes. The most popular ride times range between 0 and 25 minutes, with sharp declines after that. Secondly, the longer trips seem to be taken by males based on the slightly more gradual decrease in the second line chart.

#### The above two heatmaps show the breakdown by most popular times of the day for bike rides. Once again, we see that the darker colors show around the morning and evening rush hours, indicating that both males and females use the service to get to and from work. As was expected, the heat map is darker for males because there are about three times more riders, as shown in our earlier chart of the gender breakdown.

#### This chart is slightly different in that it shows a breakdown by user type. We examined whether riders were yearly subscribers or just one time customers. The darker colors in the heatmap of the subscriber area of the chart show that the majority of riders are subscribers. It also shows that for subscribers, Thursday and Friday are the two most popular days of the week to ride. For non-subscribers, Saturday is the most popular.
